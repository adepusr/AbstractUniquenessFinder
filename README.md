# AbstractUniquenessFinder

## INTRODUCTION

The project entitled Project Abstract Uniqueness Finder is the Java Web
application. This system is used to find the unique abstracts uploaded by the students.
## 
Mainly in the colleges like technical and non-technical at the last year or semester
students has to do the projects. Faculty are facing problem to check the project,
whether seniors done or not. Faculty is comparing the title with the previous title
from book, where head of the department maintained the list. This is a problem for
the faculty to check the abstract with each and every batch projects.
### 
Main objective of this project is developing an environment for the faculty to
find out the abstract uniqueness automatically, just by uploading an abstract
submitted by the student. It will display the uniqueness percentage too by comparing
with previous abstracts and automatic acceptance or rejection is done by comparing
with the threshold stop value of uniqueness. Thus it reduces the burden on the faculty
in-charge.

The following are the list of key functionalities in this proposed system.
#### Faculty can automatically find the unique abstract

#### Abstract acceptance can be generated automatically with stop value uniqueness
#### Faculty can find the list of abstracts submitted domain wise
